    <!-- WHAT AMSON DOES -->
    <h2>What AMSON Is & What It Does</h2>
    <p>
      AMSON is an educational, paper trading platform designed to help users
      learn how financial markets work, practice trading strategies, and explore
      investment decision-making using simulated (virtual) capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Platform provides tools such as paper trading, market insights,
      algorithm-based trade signals, community sentiment indicators, and
      investment suggestions based on hypothetical inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      AMSON is built for learning, exploration, and practice — not for executing
      real trades or managing real money.
    </p>


    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>AMSON</strong>.
      By accessing or using the AMSON website, mobile application, or any related
      services (collectively, the “Platform”), you agree to be bound by the
      following Terms & Conditions (“Terms”).

    <p>
      If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use the Platform.
